# Python

### General

```python
“”” #three quotation marks used before and after multiple line comment  
** #exponent  
% #modulo remainder   
```

### Strings

```python
\ #fix a string, placed before an apostrophe to stop a string from ending  
[index] #placed after to denote the specific character in the string  
   [index1:index2] #returns everything from the letter at index 1 till right before the second index
len() #tells how many characters there are  
.lower() #makes a string completely lower case  
.upper() #makes a string completely upper case  
str() #makes anything a string  
%s % (string_1, string_2) #% operator replaces a %s in a string with the string variable that comes after  
string.split() #takes a string a makes into a list  
float() #make into decimal number  
#Comparators: check if a value is (or is not) equal to, greater than (or equal to), or less than (or equal to) another value  
== #equal to  
!= #not equal to  
<= #less than or equal to  
>= #greater than or equal to  
not #gives the opposite of the statement  
   #Not True is False
raw_input() #accepts a string, prints it, and waits for user response  
.isalpha() #returns true when there are only characters
```
### Boolean operations:  

   1. not
   2. and
   3. or

###Conditional Statement  

```python
if some_function():  
    #block line one  
#There should never be anything in following else  
```

### Function: 

1. header: def, name of function, parameters, and colon  
2. body: describes the procedures the function carries out  
Call a function by typing the name of the function and parameters (if it has any)  
Parameter: acts as a variable name for an argument  

####ANONYMOUS FUNCTION  

```python
lambda x: x % 3 == 0   
   return x % 3 == 0  
   #with lambda, you don’t have to name the function which makes it anonymous  
filter #filters out stuff  
```

### Lists  
lists datatype used to store information as a sequence under a single variable name  
*assign items to a list: list_name = [item_1, item_2]*

```python
list_name[index] #tells what is there  
.append() #adds to a list (takes one argument)  
.index() #tells the first index of the argument; works with strings  
.insert(index, string) #inserts the string at the index and moves everything down 1 index  
sorted(list) #sorts everything in order  
.sort() #sorts everything in a list into alphabetical order (or numerical order)  
.remove(item) #removes item from list  
list.pop(index) #removes the item at index from the list and return it to you  
del(list[1]) #like .pop in that it will remove the item at the given index, but it won't return it  
.join(list_name) #joins the things in the list together by whatever comes before the .join  
   #Ex. letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']  
print " ".join(letters)  
   #prints out: a b c d
```

#### LIST COMPREHENSION  

```python
new_list = [x for x in range(1,6)]  
#=> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
#### LIST SLICING  

```python
[start:end:stride]  
```

   When using the default start/end, still need to use colon  
   A negative stride goes from right to left  

### For Loops  

```python
for variable in list_name:  
```

### Dictionaries  

```python
d = {'key1' : 1, 'key2' : 2, 'key3' : 3}  

"""Dictionary called d with three keys, ‘key1’ has a value of 1 and so on  
   refer to thing before colon to get value after colon  
   only accepts one argument"""
dict_name[new_key] = new_value #adds a dictionary entry  
del dict_name[key_name] #removes a dictionary entry  
dict_name[key] = new_value #assigns a new value to a key
dict_name[key]#you can go to any key by typing
dictionary_name.keys() #returns dictionary keys  
dictionary_name.values() #returns dictionary values  
```

### Range:  

```python
range(6) # => [0,1,2,3,4,5]  
range(1,6) # => [1,2,3,4,5]  
range(1,6,3) # => [1,4]  

range(stop)  
range(start, stop)  
range(start, stop, step) #step is how much each item increases by  
```

### Loops  

```python
while #similar to if statement; executes code inside of it if some condition is true  
else # will execute anytime the loop condition is evaluated to False  
   #in the case of a break, else will not be executed  
enumerate function #supplies index to each element in a list that is passed in a loop  
for variable in enumerate(list)  
zip #passes two (or more) lists, creating pairs (or larger) at the list index; stops at the shorter list  
for variable, another_variable in zip(list_a, list_b):  
break #ends a for loop  
```

### File I/O:  

```python
my_file.write("Data to be written") #edite a file
write() #takes string argument   
file_name.write(“string” + “\n”) #in order to write values on separate lines
file_name.read() #reads the file  
.readline() #each time .readline() is called, the next line will be returned/printed  
with open("file", "mode") as variable:  
    #Read or write to the file  
open(“text_file”, “letter”) #opens the text file in a certain mode (w stands for write, r stands for write, r+ stands for read and   write)  
my_file.close() #closes a file; always needs to be done  
file_name.closed #if the file is closed, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false  
```

### Class: 

```python
objects #data structure that contains data and function  
method #functions of objects  
class #way of organizing and making objects with similar characteristics and functions  
pass #does nothing, allows something to function without having to have something  
class NewClass(object):  
   #class keyword, name of class, and new class; user defined class name starts with Letter  
__init__() #function that initializes the objects created; usually use self as the parameter in init  
   #gets called whenever a new instance of a class is created; exists by default, but defining the function overrides the default
dot notation #puts attributes to objects; can access attribute by variable_name_of class.attribute_name  
   #Used to tell an instance of a class to use a method (function) in that class  
instance.method() #calls the method written in class because the instance is an instance of the class  
   #Ex of classes: Integers, Floats, Strings, Lists, Dictionaries, and Booleans  
   #Ex of methods: Inside the List class, .append() is a method  
      #assigns a variable to a class, creating a member variable  
self #self is the first parameter in __init(); Python uses the first parameter of __init__() to refer to the object being created; gives the object created its identity  
inheritance #in the case where there is an is-a relationship (e.g. panda is a bear) the specific class could inherit from the more 
super #if you override a class that has a function you still need  
class Derived(Base):  
   def m(self):  
      return super(Derived, self).m(arguments_the_method_takes)  
      #m would be the method from the base class that you need  
__repr__() #“representation”; built-in method that overrides;   
```

### Etc.  

```python
, #after our print statement means that our next print statement keeps printing on the same line  
module #file that contains definitions (variables and functions) that someone can use once it is imported  
   #when using a function from a module, you have to type module_name.function_name  
generic import #imports everything from a module  
function import #pulls in a single function form a module using from  
   from module import function  
universal import #import all variables and functions in a module without having to type module_name.  
   from module import *  
max() #takes any number of arguments and returns the largest one  
min() #returns the smallest of arguments  
abs() #returns absolute value of argument  
type() #returns type of data of argument  
int() #returns an integer
int(string, base) #converts the number into base 10 from the base
```

####Bitwise Operators

```python
0b #start a binary number and python can interpret it
bin() #takes an integer and returns it in binary

##### BIT SHIFT

0b000001 << 2  # 0b000100 (1 << 2 = 4)
0b0010100 >> 3 # 0b000010 (20 >> 3 = 2)
#integer & another_integer #compares the two numbers at a bit level and returns all the similarities
   a:   00101010   42
   b:   00001111   15       
===================
   a & b:   00001010   10
#integer | another_integer #similar to and, if either exhibits it, it returns
   a:  00101010  42
   b:  00001111  15       
================
    a | b:  00101111  47
#integer ^ integer: like the |; if either of the corresponding bits of the two numbers are on, but not both
   a:  00101010   42
   b:  00001111   15       
================
   a ^ b:  00100101   37

~integer #flips all the bits (adds one and multiplies by negative 1)
mask = some_bit #set a variable called mask; check to see if a bit is turned on by running it through an if statement:
num  = 0b1100
mask = 0b0100
desired = num & mask
if desired > 0:
   print "Bit was on"
#can also turn a mask on using |
#can also switch everything to opposite setting by using mask = 0b1111111… and ^
